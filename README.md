# Regex Engine

## Description
This project aims to implement a basic regex engine in Python. Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. This engine will provide a simplified version of regex functionality, focusing on core concepts such as character matching, wildcards, and repetition.

## Features
- **Character matching:** Match specific characters in a string.
- **Wildcards:** Match any character.
- **Repetition:** Match characters or patterns multiple times using quantifiers like '*', '+', and '?'.
- **Alternation:** Match either/or patterns.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regex-engine.git

Navigate to the project directory:
   
```bash
cd regex-engine
```

Run the regex_engine.py script with Python:
```bash
python3 regex_engine.py
```
